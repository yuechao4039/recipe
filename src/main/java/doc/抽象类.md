抽象类
==================

You would define a constructor in an abstract class if you are in one of these situations:
* **you want to perform some initialization (to fields of the abstract class) 
before the instantiation of a subclass actually takes place**

* **you have defined final fields in the abstract class 
but you did not initialize them in the declaration itself; in this case, 
you MUST have a constructor to initialize these fields**


* you may define more than one constructor (with different arguments)

* you can (should?) define all your constructors protected (making them public is pointless anyway)

* your subclass constructor(s) can call one constructor of the abstract class; 
it may even have to call it (if there is no no-arg constructor in the abstract class)


In any case, don't forget that if you don't define a constructor, 
then the compiler will automatically generate one for you 
(this one is public, has no argument, and does nothing).
